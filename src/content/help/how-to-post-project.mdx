At Leadhive, we've structured the project posting process into three simple phases to ensure you get the best matches for your needs.

| Phase          | Description                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `Details`     | Define your project requirements and specifications |
| `Review`      | Get proposals from qualified service providers      |
| `Selection`   | Choose your perfect service provider match          |

<Note variant="info">
  We've designed the simplest yet most effective project posting process. This
  allows you to focus on finding the right service provider while our platform
  handles all the matching and coordination.
</Note>

When posting a project, think of it as creating a clear roadmap for service providers to understand your needs. Our smart form guides you through all essential details, making it easy to get relevant proposals.

You can start posting your project from our [post project page](/).
